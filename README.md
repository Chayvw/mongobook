## Description
 An application where a user can create a profile by signing up with an email and valid password. The user can then add a book by tile and author to their page which would be logged into the database. An option to go back and update with a genre is available as well. There is also user login verification handled by JWT. Technologies used Node, Express, Postman, MongoDB Atlas, and NPM Packages.

## Installation

Select the Heroku link to deploy the web application [Heroku](https://mongodbbook.herokuapp.com/). Current development is back end focused and should be used on postman to test routes after running a command of npm install.

## Future Development 
Client side build. Will look to used ReactJS to render the browser view and a third party book api where a user can search titles.
